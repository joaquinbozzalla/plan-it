# Daily planner!

https://daily-planner-67a7f.firebaseapp.com/

This web app is designed to help you plan your day in the simplest way possible. It's focused on short-term planning, you can only schedule today and tomorrow.

I built this app at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when I needed a simple tool to plan my day at home, with a clean UI and only the essential features. The idea is to use it in the morning to plan your day, or at night to plan for the next day. I also wanted a straightforward interface that would show the current task along with a timer indicating how much time is left.

## Instructions

1. Sign up.
2. Use the top bar to choose the day you want to plan. You can only view yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
3. Click and drag on the 24-hour timeline to select a time interval.
4. Each task must have a name. You can also choose a color, an icon, and a category.
5. Open the drawer (left button on the top bar) to access the list of categories. Each category has a default icon and color so you donâ€™t have to pick them every time you create a task.
6. To log out, go to the options menu (right button on the top bar).

## Upcoming improvements

1. Adapt the UI for mobile use.
2. Guest mode.
3. Add playlist support for each task. E.g., study music or workout music.
